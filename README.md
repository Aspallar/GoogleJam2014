*Node.js solutions to a Google Code Jam*

I used the questions in this 2014 [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2929486/dashboard#s=p0) as an exercise when learning Node.js.
These are my solutions.

Problem | Solution 
:---: | ---
A | sudoku.js 
B | party.js
C | hex.js
D | dragon.js
E | ignore.js

These were written while node was still in its long beta, so they may
not work with the current version.
